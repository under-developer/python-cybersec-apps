WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS
=========================
    - Configure custom scan modes and store them for future audits.
    - Run all scan modes in chain.
    - Add Script Nmap NSE modes.
    - Generate nice directory structure, i.e.:
        192.168.1.1 $ tree        
        .
        |-- all
        |   |-- 192.168.1.1.nmap
        |   `-- 192.168.1.1.xml
        |-- fast
        |   |-- 192.168.1.1.nmap
        |   `-- 192.168.1.1.xml
        |-- os
        |   |-- 192.168.1.1.nmap
        |   `-- 192.168.1.1.xml
        `-- version
            |-- 192.168.1.1.nmap
            `-- 192.168.1.1.xml
        

WHAT YOU CAN NOT DO WITH THIS
=============================
    - Scan network ranges (see wscan tool).


HOW THE wmodes.conf WORKS
=========================
    - First, you can easily edit with 'wnmap -e' command.
    - The file is organize into lines splitted by ';'
        - First column: wnmap mode - this will set up the way it will be called from wnmap.
            - i.e.: -F;fast;-F;false => $ wscan -F target.com
            - NOTE: '-F' '-T' '-F' <= right ; '-scan' <= wrong
        - Second column: wnmap name - this will fix the human radeable name - used for 
            create directories and so on.
        - Third column: nmap mode - command for nmap to run out.
        - Fourth column: boolean flag - will tell wnmap if sudo is required for nmap command.


TL;DR
=====
    - Scan host with {1..N} custom modes.
    - Create your own modes.
    - Get all results in a nice way for latest report.
