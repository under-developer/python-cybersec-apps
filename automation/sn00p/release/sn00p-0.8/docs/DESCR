sn00p is a modular tool written in bourne shell and designed to chain and
automate security tools and tests. It parses target definitions from the command
line and runs corresponding modules afterwards. sn00p can also parse a given nmap
logfile for open tcp and udp ports. All results will be logged in specified
directories and a report can subsequently be generated.

this code is dedicated to my friend ZELJKO, who passed away (2nd Dec 2012).
